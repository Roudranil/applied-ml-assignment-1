# Email spam classification

This assignment is a part of the Applied ML course of my MSc. Data Science Program at Chennai Mathematical Institute.

Assignment 1: Prototype [due 6 Feb 2024]
1. Build a prototype for email spam classification 
   - in prepare.ipynb write the functions to 
   - load the data from a given file path
   - preprocess the data (if needed)
   - split the data into train/validation/test 
   - store the splits at train.csv/validation.csv/test.csv
2. in train.ipynb write the functions to
   - fit a model on train data
   - score a model on given data
   - evaluate the model predictions
   - validate the model
     * fit on train
     * score on train and validation
     * evaluate on train and validation
     * fine-tune using train and validation (if necessary)
   - score 3 benchmark models on test data and select the best one
